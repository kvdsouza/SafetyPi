First things first: set up clock and lights (similar to past stuff).
OK - sensor is working but calibrating around 661.
now - turn this into analog and digital sign in, as well as calibrate temperature.
then - build out console to read this as well as clock. Goal - finish this by tonight.

Tempearture Sensor
ECP32 - with python scripts etc.

Calibrate Temp Sensors - change power and ground spots. 

Figure out lights and clock going.

Next, do any sensor activity.
Next, get ESP32 going.
