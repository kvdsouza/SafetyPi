Goal: Grow in confidence with a coding project. This class has been a great experience. I started the class being very uncomfortable with coding, being rusty, and lacking experience. I've come a long ways since Week 1. For me, the last step to getting over my lack of confidence is building a solo project. To do so, I'd like to start with baby steps and build my way up and up and up. I am willing to work hard and build a good final project.
