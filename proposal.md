Smartifying Project:
"Tile"ing my Pi (and Possible Extension Modules):

Making my Raspberry Pi Smarter For a Home. 

Goal: Grow in confidence with a coding project. This class has been a great experience. I started the class being very uncomfortable with coding, being rusty, and lacking experience. I've come a long ways since Week 1. For me, the last step to getting over my lack of confidence is building a solo project. To do so, I'd like to start with baby steps and build my way up and up and up. I am willing to work hard and build a good final project.

Idea 1: I almost lost my keys over Thanksgiving Break and I thought about purchasing a Tile to keep track off some of these materials.  

Creating a module for GPS. GPS Sensor. Locking your washing machine. 
Heat Sensor and Running with some Stuff.
If I finish with this, read weather to screen.

How do we get stuff moving forwards. 
Still in progress - revising this.


Here is a suggested outline for your proposal. You don't need to follow this
outline, but it may help you focus your project.

* Project title
* Team members
* Description (1 pp describing the basic idea)
* Hardware required (itemize what hardware, if any, you need)
* Funds requested (the amount you will want to be reimbursed, remember you have
  a $20 budget per person)
* Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task
* Goals for next week
* References and resources used

Keep the proposal short and to the point.

We suggest you try to get all the major hardware components working by the
first week. That will leave the following week for putting the components
together into a working system.
